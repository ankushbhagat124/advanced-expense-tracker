# Advanced Expense Tracker

Developed a voice powered Expense Tracker React App which is very easy to use and will come handy in order to
manage day to day expenses.

• Created a scalable React Folder structure for handling all the previous data and used charts.js for piecharts.

• Implemented Speechly software to add voice capabilities to the application.

• Used Materialize CSS to design the app, and local storage along with context reducer was used to fetch the data and store it dynamically.
